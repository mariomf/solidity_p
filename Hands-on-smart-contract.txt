In 2019, the global, public Ethereum network had more nodes than any other blockchain network. 
With over 12,000 nodes, it’s unlikely that any two nodes will have the exact same set of peers. 
As a transaction enters the network through a single peer, it spreads quickly around the world to every node. 
Similarly, when a new block is added to the blockchain, news of this addition spreads quickly. 
*****Unfortunately, quickly is not the same as instantaneously, meaning that when two blocks are created at the same time by two different nodes, 
the respective peers of those diverging nodes will be operating on two different versions of the blockchain. 
This is called a temporary fork. In general, temporary forks are resolved by granting precedence to whichever fork adds the next block, 
summarized as “longest chain wins.” These rules are determined by a blockchain’s consensus protocol.

CONSENSUS PROTOCOL:
There are three protocols that we need to cover, and we’ll start with Proof-of-Work, which Ethereum used when they launched their blockchains.
Proof-of-Work: (PoW) con poder computational
Proof-of-Stake: (PoS) pruba de participacion
Proof-of-Authority: (PoA) permisos a solo algunos nodos de agregar bloques.

Serenity will also replace the existing EVM with eWASM (Ethereum flavored WebAssembly).

La velicidad en la que las transacciones se procesan dependen entre mas gas el menten mas rapido y del protocolo de conceso.

**** SMART CONTRACTS SECURITY ****
One reason why having a secure smart contract is so important is that you cannot edit your contract once it’s on the blockchain. 
Once it’s out there, it’s not possible to patch a fix like we can in other types of software development. 
- Types of Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:
*Unprotected Function: 
*Transaction Ordering Dependence:
*Integer Overflow and Underflow:
*Reentrancy:
*Cross-function race conditions:
*Block Gas Limit:
*Timestamp Depencdence:
*
